In this case, the file to unzip is `News_Category_Dataset.zip`. This step will extract the JSON file needed for data loading.\n","\n","3. **Load the Dataset**:\n","   - Import the `pandas` library (if not already imported) using `import pandas as pd` to handle the dataset. Load the JSON file using `pd.read_json`, specifying the path `/content/News_Category_Dataset_v3.json` and setting `lines=True` to correctly format the dataset as each JSON object is stored on a separate line.\n","\n","4. **Select Relevant Columns**:\n","   - From the loaded dataset, select only the columns 'headline' and 'category' for further analysis. Ensure that any missing values in these columns are removed by using the `.dropna()` method. This will help in maintaining the quality and consistency of the data being analyzed.\n","\n","5. **Preprocess Text Data**:\n","   - Convert the text in the 'headline' column to string type to standardize the format for textual analysis. This is achieved by applying `.astype(str)` to the 'headline' column, which ensures that all entries are treated as strings.\n","\n","6. **Filter and Display Selected Categories**:\n","   - Define a list of categories of interest (e.g., 'POLITICS', 'ENTERTAINMENT', 'BUSINESS', 'SPORTS'). Filter the dataset to include only these categories by checking if the 'category' column values are in the predefined list `top_categories`.\n","   - Display the first few headlines and the count of entries per category in the filtered dataset to verify the filtering process and to get a preliminary view of the data distribution among these top categories.
